# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple project I created during the break after my very first programming class.  

I wanted to build something fun using some of the methods that I had learned and I liked the idea of building **ANYTHING** that could be used outside of the terminal window.  

I utilized the pygame module to create a game window where the user can make their choices via mouse clicks.  
```
import pygame
```

The game is set up with pop-up messages to guide the player during invalid moves.

I learned a lot about the pygame module in general and how to draw items in the window using math & logic, different shapes, and colors.

I also learned a lot about how avoiding any kind of hard-coding can make changes very quick and easy.
The "constants.py" file contains all of the elements which dictate the size of the window, the colors, the grid pattern, and even the ***names*** of the players.  
**For instance:** the size of the grid (number of squares) can easily be changed by changing the ***ROW*** and ***COL*** constant.
